	<p class="italic"> The Georgia Bulldogs have consistently been one of the best teams during the 2017 season. 
	Even with the injury of sophomore quarterback, Jacob Eason, the dawgs have been able to perform 
	at a high level behind the leadership of freshman quarterback, Jake Fromm, and the guidance from head coach Kirby Smart.</p>
	<p class="italic"> The dawgs have a tough schedule against many SEC opponents and have out right dominated. 
	UGA has one of the best defenses in the nation and two incredible running backs that help them get ahead 
	in games and stay ahead. The dawgs also have two impressive wins on their resume, one against Notre Dame and Mississippi State.
	Georgia has already clinched a berth to the SEC championship and have the ability to control their own destiny if they win. 
	Winning the SEC championship would cement UGA's place in the playoff.</p>

	<p class="italic"> Even though UGA suffered a loss to the hands of the auburn tigers as the #1 team in the nation, they stilll deserve a spot in the playoff.
	If the dawgs win the SEC championship there is no question whether or not they will be in the playoff. However if the lose there is still a strong case 
	to put them in the playoff as a two loss team considering the opponents they have played and the talent they have on their roster.</p>
